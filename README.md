#Ffolio

Ffolio is an app designed to make it easier for Creatives to upload, display and submit their work. The app was engineered from a mobile-first perspective and the current version features:

* Beautiful layouts
* Simple drag n' drop uploads
* Fully responsive
* Text Editor (for written pieces)
* Simple submission interface
* Gallery/Publication Directory
* And more...

Using a combination of Rails and AngularJS, we have created an app that takes advantage of the best parts of each framework to deliver an app that is fast, powerful and economic to host.
